    <h1>Dear Friend</h1>
    <p> When to the session of sweet silent thought <br>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<br>
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<br>
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<br>
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,<br>
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:<br>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<br>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br>
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br>
All losses are restored and sorrows end.<br>

        Nobody’s born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <strong>Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <em>Until one day, you walk.</em></strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        <em>Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.</em><br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you <strong>keep going.</strong><br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because <strong><em>the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.</em></strong><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong><em>You can learn anything.</em></strong>
