    <h1>Dear Friend</h1>
    <p> When to the session of sweet silent thought <br>
I summon up remembrance of things past,<br>
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,<br>
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:<br>
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,<br>
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,<br>
And weep afresh love's long since cancelled woe,<br>
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:<br>
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,<br>
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er<br>
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,<br>
Which I new pay as if not paid before.<br>
But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,<br>
All losses are restored and sorrows end.<br>
