        <p><em>The snow leopard has a long, flexible body. The paws are short and powerful. The color of the snow leopard is light, smoky gray, with spots in the form of rings and rosettes. By the way, their spots are unique, as are human fingerprints.</em></p>
        <p>The <em></em> is awesome because The snow leopard has a long and rather bushy tail. The length of the cat along with the tail reaches 200-230 cm, and the average weight is 55 kg. </p>
